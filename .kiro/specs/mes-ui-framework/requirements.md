# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for developing the MES UI Framework, focusing specifically on Phase 1 (기반 구조 설계) and Phase 2 (핵심 컴포넌트 개발) as outlined in the development plan. The framework will establish the foundational layout structure and core components including header, toolbar, and menu tree systems that will serve as the basis for the complete MES interface.
